            </center>

            <p>Demon Slayer (or Kimetsu no Yaiba) was a popular serialized manga series that also spawned a well-received anime series. The story, about a boy named Tanjiro Kamado who decides to slay demons after they kill his family and turn his
              sister Nezuko into a demon herself, has thrilled both its original Japanese audience and many other manga fans around the world.

              After 205 chapters, however, the Demon Slayer manga has ended, leaving fans wondering – what’s next? Are there any new stories that can be told about this saga – or will it continue on in other forms of media? Let’s explore some of the
              announcements and possibilities.

              Demon Slayer: The Manga

              On May 17, 2020, the final chapter of the Demon Slayer manga was released, bringing the saga to a definitive close. The last chapter actually features a time jump that reveals many of the popular characters who died fighting the demons
              were reincarnated as their descendants. Readers get to see their favorite characters finally living the happy, peaceful lives they always wanted in modern-day Japan, giving the dark and frequently painful story of Demon Slayer a happy
              ending.

              While other manga have had spin-offs and sequels after ending the original saga, Demon Slayer appears to have granted its characters a definitive end within its manga story. This does not mean, however, that fans have seen the last of
              these characters, as several other Demon Slayer projects are still in the works.

              The Demon Slayer Movie

              The Demon Slayer movie, Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba the Movie: Mugen Train, has a Japan release date of October 16, 2020. The Japanese anime film will be a direct sequel to the 2019 anime series which finished its first season on
              September 28, 2019 (in Japan) and May 2, 2020 (in the U.S.). As such, both the Japanese and English voice casts will be reprising their roles for the anime film. The film itself will take place onboard a train where Tanjiro and his
              friends are investigating several disappearances. Ultimately, they find Enmu, one of the Twelve Kizuki who has a trap for the Demon Slayer Corps.

              Demon Slayer: The Anime Series

              With Season 1 having wrapped up, Demon Slayer fans are wondering if the popular anime series will get a second season. Considering the popularity of the manga series – and the fact that the anime has yet to adapt all the stories from
              the saga yet – a second season is certainly possible. However, no official announcement has been made yet concerning Demon Slayer Season 2 from Studio Ufotable. As of now, fans will simply have to wait in anticipation for the movie
              before looking forward to new seasons of the anime series.

              Other Demon Slayer Media

              Aside from manga, anime series, and movies, Demon Slayer will continue to live on in additional media. A Demon Slayer PlayStation 4 game has been announced for 2021 which will let the player “become Tanjiro Kamado” in a competitive
              demon slaying game. Additional Demon Slayer Android and Apple iOS games are also in development. With all of these new avenues to experience Demon Slayer being explored, it’s very unlikely that fans will be wanting for any new content
              or entertainment in the near future.</p>
