            <p>Tanjiro, Nezuko, Zenitsu and Inosuke board a train [N 1] to meet the Flame Hashira Kyōjurō Rengoku and assist him in his mission to hunt for a demon that killed more than 40 demon slayers. Soon after boarding, the group is attacked by some demons that Rengoku easily kills, but after having their tickets checked by the collector, all of them fall into a deep sleep, and Enmu forces some children to approach the asleep demon slayers and use some magic ropes to enter their dreams with orders to destroy their spiritual cores so that they can never wake up again.

During their sleep, Tanjiro dreams of reuniting with his late family, Zenitsu dreams of having a date with Nezuko, Inosuke dreams of going on a cave exploration mission with Tanjiro, Zenitsu and Nezuko being his henchmen and Rengoku dreams of meeting his brother. Tanjiro realizes that he is dreaming and starts looking for ways to wake up, succeeding after being instructed by a vision of his father to kill himself inside the dream. Nezuko uses her power to burn the ropes and the children awake. In fear of Enmu, the children attack Tanjiro, except for the one who entered his dream, as he was moved by the warm scenary he found inside it and are knocked out by him.

While Nezuko awakens the others, Tanjiro meets and confronts Enmu. Tanjiro beheads Enmu, but the demon does not die and reveals that he fused his true body with the train itself. Kyojuro instructs the others to help Tanjiro look for the demon's neck and stays behind to protect the other passengers. They find Enmu's real neckbone in the engine room and Tanjiro cuts it off, killing the demon and stopping the train. Akaza, one of the Upper Moons, appears soon after and attacks the demon slayers, with Kyōjurō mortally injured while fighting him to protect the others and eventually dies from his wounds, but Akaza is forced to flee when the sun begins rising, not before being injured by Tanjiro who throws his sword at him and calls him a coward, much to his anger. As the rest of the Demon Slayer Corps is informed about Kyōjurō's death, Tanjiro and his friends mourn him in tears.As heartbreaking as it might be, you can't let these tragic events paralyze you and prevent you from persevering. is revealed that Tanjuro has the ability to foresee his opponent's attacks by seeing their blood flow, muscles and joint movement. In this state, he is also able to mask the presence of his battle spirit, hate, anger and bloodlust.</p>

        <p>In order to soothe the spirits of those it killed, and to make sure it claims no further victims... I will swing my blade down and lop of the head of any demon without mercy! But I will not belittle those who regret their actions... and suffer over the things they did as demons... I will never trample over them!	”

— Tanjiro Kamado</p>
<p>"Spirit alone isn't gonna get me anywhere! Use your head not just spirit. Think, think, think."

This quote comes about in episode 13 titled "Something More Important Than Life". Tanjiro has been struggling against Kyogai, the master of the Tsuzumi Mansion, for quite some time now. The Demon has him at his wit's end, which causes Tanjiro to pause and consider a more productive strategy. This is when he realizes that spirit alone is insufficient when it comes to certain battles. Sometimes you need to take a deep breath and tackle situations logistically and with a level head.</p>
<p>"No matter how many people you may lose, you have no choice but to go on living. No matter how devastating the blows might be."

Tanjiro says this to Kazumi — a villager who had lost his fiancée to the Swamp Demon — in episode 7, titled "Muzan Kibutsuji". Kazumi had claimed that he could never continue living without his loved one, but Tanjiro soothes him with these wise words. Pain and loss are a natural part of life; death is unavoidable. As heartbreaking as it might be, you can't let these tragic events paralyze you and prevent you from persevering.</p>
<p>"I can do it. I know I can do it. I'm the guy who gets it done, broken bones or not. No matter what, I can do it! I can fight!"

Tanjiro had a rough time in episode 13 against the aforementioned master of the Tsuzumi Mansion, Kyogai. This is partly due to the fact that he had broken several bones during his previous battle. One of the most inspiring things about Tanjiro is that he can talk himself into accomplishing just about anything he sets his mind to. It's a great quality that requires confidence and strength, so we have to admire how resilient Demon Slayer's protagonist is.</p>
