            <p>Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba recently had its greatest episode yet, and that means it’s time for a deep dive into its production: its core strengths, some recurring issues, but above everything else, the harmony between different creative departments that makes its highs so spectaculars.</p>
            <p>Truth to be told, we’d been meaning to write about Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba for months. Ufotable’s first real foray into Weekly Shonen Jump adaptations isn’t only a stunning visual spectacle, it also happens to be quite the interesting project for an already special studio. And yet, for all the positive aspects we could isolate, it never felt like they truly came together in a way that lived up to the show’s real potential… until now, that is.</p>
            <p>Which is to say that we’d refrained from writing about Demon Slayer because digging into the insidious details holding it back would have soured the tone, even with wholehearted praise of just as many impressive aspects. But now that we’ve been gifted the perfect excuse to give this piece a more positive spin and hopefully avoid raining on the parade of its fans, it’s finally time to tackle Tanjiro’s adventures: the good, the less so, and the astonishingly great highs it reached with episode #19.</p>

<p>But first comes the recap of what the series has been like up until the most recent episode. And even before that, what the production was like prior to the broadcast; even more so than usual, the end product we’re seeing here is inherently tied to the anime’s planning process, so we’ve got to do our homework as well as ufotable did if we want people to understand why Demon Slayer is the way it is.</p>
<p>o put it short and simple, Demon Slayer is a big deal. Not only is it the first Jump TV show for the studio – I see you, ufotable connoisseurs about to mention their sorta forgotten Toriko pilot – it also happens to be their first 2 cours production without a broadcast break in the middle. When facing a tricky challenge like that, most anime projects would… not do all that much different from usual, and likely crash in a nasty way halfway through. If that has conjured the image of a specific title in your brain, keep in mind that it actually applies to a depressingly large number of anime, and get just a little bid sadder.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Demon Slayer happens to be an exception to that sad routine. The parties involved had enough confidence in the project to give it plenty of time to come to fruition, hence why the production was already advancing in earnest in early 2018, essentially a year ahead of its broadcast. While we often stress out that pretty much all anime takes a long time to be made, it goes without saying that such a long span for hands-on production is outside the norm for a TV series.</p>
